## Cluster Provisioning

The present gcloud command call initializes the workshop-cluster as regional cluster configuration with one node in each of three availability zones.

_If you have already initialized the cluster, you can skip this step now!_

- Please make sure that you are also in the project prepared for this workshop or that your used dev/sandbox project has also been selected via `cloud init`!

- Init your GKE-Cluster with a unique identifier suffix

    ```bash
    printf "%s\n" "[INIT] workshop cluster"
    UNIQUE_CLUSTER_KEY=$RANDOM; gcloud container clusters create workshop-${UNIQUE_CLUSTER_KEY} \
    --machine-type n2-standard-2 \
    --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/source.read_write,cloud-platform" \
    --region europe-west1 \
    --node-locations europe-west1-b,europe-west1-c,europe-west1-d \
    --release-channel stable \
    --disk-type "pd-ssd" \
    --disk-size "60" \
    --num-nodes "1" \
    --max-nodes "1" \
    --min-nodes "1" \
    --logging=SYSTEM,WORKLOAD \
    --monitoring=SYSTEM \
    --network "default" \
    --addons HorizontalPodAutoscaling,HttpLoadBalancing,NodeLocalDNS \
    --labels k8s-scope=gke-workshop-doit,k8s-cluster=primary,k8s-env=workshop && \
    printf "%s\n" "[INIT] test access new cluster using k8s API via kubectl" \
    kubectl get all --all-namespaces && kubectl cluster-info && \
    printf "\n%s\n\n" "[INIT] workshop cluster finally initialized and available by ID -> [ workshop-${UNIQUE_CLUSTER_KEY} ] <-"
    ```

- (optional) If it is necessary to re-authenticate to the created GKE cluster (e.g. to run kubectl commands) the following command may help:

    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials workshop-${UNIQUE_CLUSTER_KEY}
    ```



## Cluster Application Deployment

Make sure you handled all previous steps of this README! Now, as announced, we perform the actual deployment of the kubernetes-dashboard and provision an access-authorized user for token-based authentication at the frontend of the application.

1. Run deployment
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f . 
  ```

2. Check current ingress state (external IP)

  _this step can take up to 3 Minutes_

  ```bash
  kubectl get ingress -n doit-lab-15 --watch
  ```

## Cluster Application Check / Playground

1. You can check the state of Pods at any time with the following kubectl command:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n doit-lab-15
  ```

2. You can check your ingress target service with the following kubectl command:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service -n doit-lab-15
  ```

3. You can get some more detailed information about your ingress resource by the following kubectl command:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe ingress neg-demo-ing -n doit-lab-15
  ```

4. As soon as your ingress resource and the corresponding loadBalancer is provisioned (3-4 minutes):

4.1 You can check the benchmark of your web-application using apache-bench command as shown below:
  ```bash
  ab -n 20 http://<external-ip-of-your-ingress-load-balancer>/
  ```

4.2 You can simulate some traffic to your ingress facing loadBalancer by the following ab-command:
  ```bash
  ab -n 500 -c 25 http://<external-ip-of-your-ingress-load-balancer>/
  ```

4.3 Or just visit the application by hitting your load-balancers external-IP:
  ```bash
    -> http://<external-ip-of-your-ingress-load-balancer>/
  ```
5. Verify ingress functionality

```bash
# scale up the deployment to two replicas
kubectl scale deployment neg-demo-app -n doit-lab-15 --replicas 2
# wait a minute or two for it to complete, and verify that you have two replicas running:
kubectl get deployment neg-demo-app -n doit-lab-15
# get your ingress' public IP:
kubectl describe ingress neg-demo-ing -n doit-lab-15
```

Then verify funtionality and count distinct responses by running:
```bash
# un this command to send 100 requests to your load balancer and count distinct responses:
INGRESS_IP="$(kubectl get ingress -n doit-lab-15 neg-demo-ing -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"
for i in $(seq 1 100); do \
  curl --connect-timeout 1 -s $INGRESS_IP && echo; \
done  | sort | uniq -c
```

The result should look similar to this:
```bash
44 neg-demo-app-7f7dfd7bc6-dcn95
56 neg-demo-app-7f7dfd7bc6-jrmzf
```

## Application Clean-Up

```bash
kubectl delete -f .
```
